## Introduction & Patterns of diversity in the fossil record

For this lecture, we will be introducing you to the course material and what we will cover this semester. Then, there will be a lecture on the paleontological perspective of macroevolution. To prepare for class, please read [Benton (2015)](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1810/20150569). A PDF of this paper can be found on the [Canvas](https://canvas.iastate.edu/) site.
